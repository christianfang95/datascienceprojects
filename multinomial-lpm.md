$$Pr(Y_{i} = c) = \frac{e_exp{c}}{\sum{i}}$$

# Introducing the MLPM

## Mathematical notation for the MLPM

The joke about the MLPM is that is is merely a series of separate linear



I am not 100% sure about the mathematical notation for the "multinomial LPM" (since I just made it up...), but it should be something like this:

$$Pr(Y_{i} = k) = \alpha + \sum_{j=1}^{k-1} \beta_{k}X_{i}$$

In other words, we fit K-1 linear probability models 

# Does it work?
